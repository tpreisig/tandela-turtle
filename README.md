# tandela-turtle

In the very beginning there was this little turtle named Tandala. He lived in a beautiful garden. It had a big heart and a curious mind. One day he decided to explore his garden and found out that it was full of secrets waiting to be discovered. That was how it all began.

For the sake of illustration and documentation this Turtle project deserves a repository on my Github account.
